Welcome to the Happy Garden The Game! In this game, you take on the role of a friendly pig whose mission is to keep the garden happy and thriving.
Your goal is to water wilted flowers while avoiding pesky fangflowers and T-Rexes that can spoil your fun.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys to move the pig character around the garden.
Press the spacebar to water wilted flowers and restore their happiness.
Watch out for fangflowers and T-Rexes! If the pig collides with them, the game will be over.
Try to keep the garden happy for as long as possible by watering wilted flowers and avoiding obstacles.
If any flowers remain wilted for more than 10 seconds, the game will end.
After the game is over, the game over screen will be displayed for 5 seconds, and then the game will automatically restart.
